This version of the courses use the platform agnostic GNU syntax supported by the GNU assembler (as). Unlike the ARM Assembly Programming From Ground Up™ 1 &2 courses which use Keil uVision which available on the Windows operating system only, the ARM GNU Assembly Programming From Ground Up™ course teaches you how to write assembly programs for the GNU assembler which is available on Windows, OSX and Linux. Covering ARM Systems Design, Architecture and Practical Assembly Programming, this is the most comprehensive ARM assembly course online. I'll take you step-by-step through engaging and fun video tutorials and teach you everything you need to know to succeed as an ARM embedded developer. By the end of this course you will master the ARM Instruction Set, the Thumb Instruction Set and the Thumb-2 Instruction Set. You will be able to create data structures such as FIFOs in assembly. You will also be able to create Finite State Machines such as the Moore Machine using only assembly code. Furthermore, this course teaches you how to navigate the microcontroller reference manual and datasheet to extract the right information to professionally build peripheral drivers and firmware. To achieve this goal, no libraries are used in this course, purely ARM Assembly Language. You will be able to write peripheral drivers in assembly-ADC, UART, SYSTICK, GPIO, GPTM. Specially Designed For People Who Hate Copy/Paste Listen. If you don’t like “Copy/Paste” you’re not alone. I can’t stand it either. I’d literally rather have a piece of code that I wrote from scratch that doesn’t work than someone else’s working code I copied and pasted. And that’s why I’ve spent months designing and recording this course in which I show you how to locate every single register used and the meaning of every hexadecimal value written into the register. By the end of this course... You Will Be Able To : Master the ARM Instruction Set Master the Thumb and Thumb-2 Instruction Sets Write Complex programs in Assembly Language Implement State Machines in Assembly Language Implement Data Structures in Assembly Language Write ADC Drivers in Assembly Language Write UART Drivers in Assembly Language Write GPTM Drivers in Assembly Language Write GPIO Drivers in Assembly Language",

The first part focuses on peripheral driver development, teaching you how to use the STM32CubeMX framework to set up clocks and register parameters, and then complete development and testing in the CubeIDE environment. You will master configurations for peripherals such as USB, PWM, SPI, ADC, UART, and DMA. The second part covers developing embedded firmware applications using Middleware provided by STM32CubeMX, including the FreeRTOS Realtime Kernel. You will learn to create tasks, semaphores, and other kernel components for real-time firmware development. The third part deals with using CubeIDE as a standalone development environment, where you will develop bare-metal embedded-C firmware and drivers without libraries, using only the microcontroller's datasheet. The course also delves into STM32 HAL APIs Driver Development, offering a solid foundation in firmware and peripheral driver development for STM32 microcontrollers. You will learn to navigate the microcontroller's reference manual and datasheet to build professional drivers and firmware using STM32 Low-Layer APIs (LL), which provide low-level APIs at the register level for better optimization. Additionally, the course covers Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming for ARM-based microcontrollers, focusing on developing firmware without libraries, using bare-metal embedded-C and register manipulations. You will configure peripherals like ADC, UART, PWM, GPIO, TIMER, I2C, and SPI, mastering the ARM architecture. The course includes specific modules for different ARM Cortex-M development boards, such as STM32F4, STM32F7, STM32L4, STM32L0, and STM32F3, allowing you to practice techniques on the development board of your choice. By the end of the course, you will be proficient in building professional embedded firmware for ARM processors, equipped with the skills to navigate datasheets and reference manuals effectively.",

For example, the communication peripherals contain APIs to initialize and configure the peripheral, manage data transfers in polling mode, handle interrupts or DMA, and manage communication errors.\n\nIn summary, the HAL offers high-level and feature-oriented APIs with a high-portability level. These hide the MCU and peripheral complexity from the end-user.\n\nWith a programming based approach, this course is designed to give you a solid foundation in firmware and peripheral driver development for the STM32 family of microcontrollers.

In this section we shall learn about the Bluetooth protocol, its history, and the key differences amongst the various protocols. We shall also compare our selected Bluetooth chips across different parameters so that you will know the right chip to use for a particular use case. Second Section: In the second section we shall develop bare-metal drivers for interfacing the Bluetooth chip to our STM32 microcontroller. We shall navigate the microcontroller’s reference manual and datasheet to extract the right information to build these drivers. Third Section: After developing our drivers for interfacing the Bluetooth chip to our STM32 microcontroller, we shall go ahead and develop efficient data structures for managing communication between the Bluetooth chip and our microcontroller. Last Section: In the last section, we shall combine the drivers and data structures developed in the previous sections to develop a library for each of our Bluetooth chips. We shall then go on to use the library to develop Bluetooth enabled firmware applications such as: Sending data over Bluetooth from an STM32 slave device to a mobile phone master device, Sending data over Bluetooth from an STM32 master device, Receiving data over Bluetooth from an STM32 slave device, Receiving data over Bluetooth from an STM32 master device, Communicating wirelessly between two STM32 microcontrollers using Bluetooth classic, Communicating wirelessly between two STM32 microcontrollers using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Controlling hardware modules by Bluetooth, Sending sensor data periodically over Bluetooth with a Realtime Clock (RTC), Sending sensor data over Bluetooth with RTC triggered alarm.

Essentially, you should be able to control your embedded device using any remote control you have lying around at home. If this is a skill you want to add to your embedded skillset, then take a look at our Embedded IR Remote Control with NEC Protocol course. So with that understood, let me tell you… Exactly What You’re Getting This course can be divided into 4 major sections. First Section: The first section is theoretical. In this section we learn about IR remote control modulation and encoding theory, and also the structure and features of the NEC protocol. Over here we shall deal with topics such as Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) modulation vs Frequency Shift Keying Modulation (FSK), Pulse Position Encoding, Pulse Width Encoding, Pulse Distancing Encoding, Frame Format of the NEC protocol. Second Section: In the second section we shall develop all the drivers to help us debug and implement some real-world applications once we have developed all modules of the system. Over here we shall develop: A Timebase to help us generate precise delays, An ADC driver to help us sample sensor data when a particular key is pressed on the IR Remote control, A UART driver to help us to print out debug information, A GPIO driver to turn on the light when a particular key is pressed on the IR Remote control. Third Section: In the third section we shall develop the drivers and library required for interfacing the IR receiver to our microcontroller and decoding the received pulses. Over here we shall develop: An external interrupt driver for detecting edge changes from our IR receiver pin, A timer driver for measuring pulse length, And then we shall develop the library for fully decoding the pulses received by the IR receiver. Last Section: Once all the system drivers and library are fully developed, we then develop some real-world applications. We shall develop firmware application for turning on the light based on the key pressed on the remote control, We shall develop firmware application for sampling and displaying sensor data based on the key pressed, We shall develop firmware application for displaying the time based on the key pressed, We shall develop firmware application for displaying the key pressed on any remote control we have at home, the reason this will work is because most remote controls are based on the NEC protocol.",
